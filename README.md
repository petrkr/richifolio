==========

Project which read banks, crypto and other assets portfolio and make it to one place. Main goal is not have data stored at 3rd party servers like other projects which do same.

Goal is every user should be able run this on our server or computer without 3rd party database.
All data will be downloaded directly from bank / exchange / whatever. Only some local cache could be used to protect offten calls to API servers.


If you like idea, consider buying me a beer.
